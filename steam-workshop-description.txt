[h1] Undo the Spire [/h1]
[b]Undo the Spire[/b] is a [i]Slay the Spire[/i] mod that adds a button to undo your actions in combat.
[list]
[*] Played a block card before you realised you had lethal? [b]UNDO![/b]
[*] Forgot you had Echo Form active and doubled a Strike instead of Biased Cognition? [b]UNDO![/b]
[*] Lost your Buffer to the Heart's Beat of Death? [b]UNDO![/b]
[/list]
With so many interactions happening in the game, it's nearly impossible to be aware of everything at all times – unless you're [url=https://www.twitch.tv/xecnar]a certain Vietnamese player[/url], of course. Mistakes are inevitable, and it's especially frustrating when a tiny misplay has the potential to ruin your entire run. If you've ever experienced this – and ended up resorting to [strike]savescumming[/strike] accepting your fate and restarting, after your game decided to crash mid-fight – this mod is for you.

[h2]What does it do?[/h2]
[b]Undo the Spire[/b] literally only does one thing: add buttons to undo/redo your actions in combat.

[h2]What does it not do?[/h2]
[list]
[*] Allow undoing outside of combat (yet!).
[*] Work with controller (yet!).
[*] Guarantee that you boss swap into Pandora's Box every time (yet!).
[/list]

[h2]Installation[/h2]
[olist]
[*] Click the "Subscribe" button, just below the screenshot at the top of this page.
[*] If prompted "Additional Required Items", click "Subscribe to all"; this will install other mods that [b]Undo the Spire[/b] requires to function, namely ModTheSpire, BaseMod, StsLib, and Save State Mod.
[*] Run [i]Slay the Spire[/i] from Steam, and select "Play With Mods" when prompted. If you don't see this prompt after you launch the game, open [i]Slay the Spire[/i]'s settings, and under [i]General → Launch options → Selected Launch Option[/i] pick "Play With Mods" (or "Ask when starting game" if you want to decide on a per-launch basis).
[*] You should now see a window with a list of mods. Select BaseMod, StSLib, STS Save State Mod, and Undo the Spire, together with any other mods you want to use.
[*] Click "Play".
[/olist]
If everything is set up correctly, you should now be able to play [i]Slay the Spire[/i] with [b]Undo the Spire[/b].
